It was a long ago. I had the plan to move to NZ, 

I also began my plan, resigned from my job, and tried to move to New Zealand. But the pandemic came, I had to give up my plan.But recently, a few months ago, the immigration organization reacted to my work visa, so I resigned from my job immediately and began my plan. I’m very committed to relocating to New Zealand. So my long time plan is to make a life for my family and me here in New Zealand, and stick with our company.

Three years ago, I married and spent one month on our honeymoon in New Zealand. I love everything about New Zealand. Some things inspired me a lot.

Firstly, I’d like to talk about the **natural environment**. I had been to New Zealand three years ago, there were always blue sky and white clouds in sky and the river is very very clean. I had my honeymoon there and fell in love with this country. So I was determined to move to New Zealand three years ago.

Thirdly, it‘s **good security** in here. It’s a **safe** country. I feel safe here. I like to live in a safe country where you can go outside and go to the park and walk in the mountains.

Fourthly, it is **citizens’ kindness and eagerness to help**. I like the **people** here. On my honeymoon in New Zealand, we traveled to most of the big cities, like Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington. We also met a lot of old friends in New Zealand. And they were very kind to have dinner with us. They were **hospitable**, open, and friendly, and they had lunch or dinners with us.

Everyone on the street said hello to us if we met them. It was quite amazing experience.

If I asked where’s that place or where can I find that, they were very eager to help.They were always ready to help you. I felt welcomed in new Zealand.

## Why do you want to leave your job?

I had this **immigration** plan for a long time, but the pandemic stopped my plan for about three years. My work visa recently became active again a few months ago, so I decided to continue my immigration plan. I resigned from my job to seek new opportunities in New Zealand.

~~Secondly, I want to take on more responsibilities in my next job opportunity.
e.g. I work as an iOS developer, but if the company requests me to perform any additional roles, I would happily agree. Because taking on more responsibilities will help me enhance my skills and experience.~~

//TODO: position **expectations**

## What type of work do you need? Contract work or permanent full-time job?

At this time, I am only considering **permanent full-time** employment, not contract work. However, if I change my mind, I will let you know again.

Generally speaking, I was working as an iOS developer. However, during my work, I have to perform as a backend developer to develop the API, which is short for an application programming interface.

In addition, I’d like to introduce my primary role as an iPhone platform developer. I developed some trendy applications in the app store, like the XXX application and some popular frameworks. I used to use some programming languages like react-native and objective-c, swift. But, I still want to go further.

## What are your salary requirements?

## What are your salary and your expectations?

~~My first aspiration is to work in New Zealand. A secondary factor would be remuneration; perhaps my most recent salary would be a good guideline for you. Salary is not my predetermining condition; Working in New Zealand is.~~

~~A m**arket salary** would be great.~~

~~I want to share my last salary.~~ 

I am **particular** about my salary. I prepared for a **certain number** about the salary, say $XXX this is what I have in mind. 

(it's essential to say what you expect. Then the company will maybe come in with a lower offer. But then you can also say, I can't accept this one, but $xxx more. So you can negotiate, but go in with a number.)

## What is your hobby? What do you do to relax well?

I like exercising because I want to be a **balanced person**.

If I had time, I'd like to post blogs on the internet, share my experience with the public, conclude my knowledge, and try to share knowledge with the public.

## How are you going to settle since you're going to be with different nationalities?

What is the first thing you will do after working in New Zealand as a software engineer? How are you going to settle well?

Before I answer this question, I'd like to share my experience. I had been to New Zealand three years ago. When I xxx, this was my second time in New Zealand.

So, how can I adapt to life in New Zealand?

The most important thing is to continue my career in New Zealand and build strong relationships with the people I meet.

I have a lot of friends in New Zealand, and I also keep connected with them tightly, we share information about New Zealand, and I think it was pretty helpful, and I learned a lot of things about New Zealand. So I think maybe the country's culture and the company's culture and values influence me a lot, and I'd like to accept those things.

## Why do you want to do this job?

//TODO: STAR

Regarding the software engineer, I think this job is very frustrating and challenging. However, through this job, I can learn a lot of technical knowledge and try to solve some customers' problems. My job will provide much value to customers. I think it is worth it. Furthermore, in terms of my current job as a mobile phone developer, it's a kind of front development. I can provide some services directly to the customers. This way, I can influence customers and help them improve their lives and work. I think it is valuable.

I like your company because it's in the city I want to live in. I like the culture at your company and the good reviews about your company.

(For this question also try to mention something about the company and why do you want this job, you spoke about the technical aspects of your career but also try mention I like your company because it's in the city I want to live in or something specific to the company that's difficult to prep in advance. or something particular to the company.)

## If today were your first day of work, what would you do?

I want to do two kinds of things. 

Firstly I'd like to be familiar with the company's culture, like the company's values.

Secondly, introduce myself to team members, and socialize with them.

Thirdly, set up digital devices and prepare for my next task. First, I will learn about which technologies we are using and prepare for the knowledge a lot. And then, I'd like to review the project code to learn a lot about the business logic. In this way, I can start my next task quickly.

### Personal
#### 1. What are your hobbies outside of work?
I usually play computer games outside of work. My favourite games are Starcraft II and Civilization 6. Besides, I have a Nintendo Switch, and sometimes I play Ring fit to keep fit, and Mario with my family. In China, I invited my former colleagues to my home, and play Switch and PS4 together. It's a great way to foster relationships with colleagues.

#### 2. Do you like our country? Why do you intend to move to this country?/Why did you apply for a job in our country?
If you have never been to this country, HR maybe ask you this question.
Take Berlin for example:
I like the vibe of a startup company so much because I can feel the vitality of a company and group up with it together. I worked in Beijing before, there are a lot of startup companies. However, the country's wave of entrepreneurship has waned due to the recent economic situation. I know the startup atmosphere in Berlin is excellent, many Unicoms emerge in this city. I think that is suitable for my career plan, so I intend to develop in Berlin and witness the development of the Internet industry.
Moreover, Some of my former colleagues and friends in technical groups are working there. They told me the price isn't expensive and I can find all kinds of food, especially since there are many Chinese restaurants. These points attract me, so I must choose Berlin as my first choice. 

#### 3. Do you have friends and/or family here? Or do you have relocation plans?
To see the above answer.
#### 4 What's your plan on the first day of working if you could join us?
I will be familiar with team members and company rules. I believe someone will introduce them to me, but I have a little bit face blind, so I need some time. Perhaps lunch or playing games together can help me be familiar with them soon.
If I can get my work computer on the first day, I'll config my development environments, such as installing necessary tools. I hope they can fit my habits and keep good working efficiency.  

#### 5. Do you prefer to work in a startup company or a big company?
I prefer to work in a startup company. There are 3 points of startup companies attracting me.
1. I worked in startup companies. I can feel the startup team is more enthusiastic and innovative. Teammates can feel the achievement that everyone creates together.
2. The hierarchy is flatter than big companies. I believe this makes communication more efficient. 
3. The startup means more opportunities to me, including promotion, and stock sharing. The more important thing is that I can witness a project and a company growing up with my colleagues.


#### 6. What does work-life balance mean to you?
The work-life balance means more flexible spare time to me. I can spend them on many things. I can rest and have amusement to restore my energy; I can have more time to be company with my family. Of course, I prefer to spend some time learning new technology or other technical space, such as backend, and AI. I believe my spare time can bring me more possibilities, which lets me have fresh ideas instead of blocking into fixed thinking.
